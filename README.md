# Network-Tracker
A python project which helps to calculate the amount of packets used per second and stores in the database. This interface has a window in which you can start the calculation of bits/second or stop. It stores the packets per second in mysql database. The packages that have been used are-

Tkinter
PIL
Time
Socket
Psutil
In this program we can set a limit for the packets being used. In this program we set a limit of 1MB/sec and whenver the packets exceeds, like when we download any file or watch videos. It will immediately show a message box saying "THE LIMIT HAS BEEN EXCEEDED". Thus letting the user know that the limit has been exceeded.

NOTE- Copy all the images in a folder and download the code and run the program.
